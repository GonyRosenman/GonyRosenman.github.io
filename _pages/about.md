## Introduction

I'm a PhD candidate at the Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University. My research focuses on data-driven psychiatry, aiming to bridge the gap between human behavior and brain activity. At its core, my work seeks to decode brain activity to explain human behavior on a global scale. I am particularly fascinated by the possibility of identifying personality traits through brain patterns captured by fMRI. Can brain activity reveal practical insights into individual differences and similarities?

## Research Journey

### Exploring fMRI and Transformers

======
My journey began with the ambition to leverage advanced Deep Learning techniques to analyze fMRI data. These efforts resulted in the development of the Transformer Framework for fMRI (TFF), the first application of pretraining and fine-tuning to fMRI data for psychiatric prediction tasks, benchmarked on the large HCP dataset. This approach is crucial as fMRI, with its high-dimensional input and small sample size, is prone to overfitting in prediction tasks and has lacked proper benchmarking.

### Advancing with Metric Learning

Recognizing the potential limitations of large-scale datasets, I turned my attention to metric learning techniques. My work in this area involved developing methods to extract meaningful representations from smaller fMRI datasets, specifically investigating the brain connectome fingerprint and formulating the 'fingerprint triplet loss'. This research has been conducted with data from the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Neuromodulation Lab, consisting of only 50 subjects, demonstrating the capability to derive significant insights even from limited data.

### Delving into Large Language Models

Recently, my research has expanded into large language models (LLMs). These models, known for their exceptional language understanding and generation capabilities, are being explored for their applications in psychiatry. My current projects focus on leveraging LLMs to enhance our understanding of symptomatology and its relation to mental health disorders, aiming to develop automatic assessment tools for mental disorders.

## Overarching Goal

The ultimate goal driving my research is to enhance global well-being by improving our understanding of the complex spectrum between normal mental health, PTSD, and depression. This mission is deeply personal, influenced by the impacts of war and conflict that have shaped my upbringing. By refining our knowledge of the connections between typical and pathological brain activities, I aim to contribute to creating healthier, more harmonious societies.
